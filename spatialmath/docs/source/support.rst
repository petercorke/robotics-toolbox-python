The easiest way to get help with the project is to join the ``#crawler``
channel on Freenode_. We hang out there and you can get real-time help with
your projects.  The other good way is to open an issue on Github_.

The mailing list at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/crawler is also available for support.
